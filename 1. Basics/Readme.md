# Basics of Swift

## Variables and Constants

Variables are declared using the `var` keyword, and are mutable. Constants are declared using the `let` keyword, and are immutable. Swift supports type annotation.

## Strings

Strings are declared using double quotes. There are many built-in methods for string manipulation.

## Numbers

There are two types of numbers in Swift: Integers and Doubles. Integers are whole numbers, and Doubles are floating point numbers. You can convert between the two types using the `Int()` and `Double()` functions. There are many built-in methods for number manipulation.

## Conditionals

Swift supports ternary conditionals, and if/else statements.
