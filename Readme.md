## About Swift

**Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc for the Apple ecosystem. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products.**
